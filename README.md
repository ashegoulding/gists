# David's Gist Repository
*Stay awhile and listen!*

Here you can find all the work I've publish on Github Gist. As Gist works as a
blog service for devs and doesn't come with version control, I thought I'd put
all the work in a git repo. Some tools I wrote for gist are actually VC-worthy
projects that I really wouldn't bother making a git repo for each.

I hope you enjoy your stay!
