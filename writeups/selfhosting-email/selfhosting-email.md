No technical notes on "IP warming up". ESPs can come up with their own warm up
policies. No BIG5 ESPs disclose their policies. So mailer services have to it
the trial and error style, and the data obtained is kept as trade secret.

But I'm sure ESPs don't treat all the IP addresses equally. I'm pretty sure they
whitelist all the government agencies and other big tech companies around the
globe. Can't imagine Yahoo or Gmail getting complaints from Dept of Home Affairs
or Internal Revenue Service. Also, there's a possibility of getting sued on the
grounds of obstruction of correspondence.

Suddenly feeling huge respect for mobile network operators for their closed
nature trying to get their shit together.
